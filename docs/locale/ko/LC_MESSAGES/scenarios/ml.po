"Scikit is a free and open-source machine learning library for Python. It "

"The dataset takes four features of flowers: sepal length, sepal width, "

"(virginica)."

"We shuffle the Iris dataset, and divide it into separate training and "

"The first line contains the labels (i.e flower species) of the testing "
